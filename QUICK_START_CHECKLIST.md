# PropertyFlow Website Quick Start Checklist
## 1-Week Implementation Plan for UKES Endorsement

**Goal**: Build minimal viable website, gather 30+ waitlist signups, strengthen UKES application
**Timeline**: 7 days
**Cost**: £10-50
**Expected Impact**: +10-15% endorsement probability

---

## DAY 1: DOMAIN & EMAIL SETUP (2 hours)

### Morning (1 hour)
- [ ] Register propertyflow.co.uk domain
  - Recommended: Namecheap (£10/year) or Google Domains (£12/year)
  - Alternative: If .co.uk taken, try propertyflow.uk or getpropertyflow.co.uk
  - **Action**: Go to Namecheap.com → Search "propertyflow.co.uk" → Purchase

### Afternoon (1 hour)
- [ ] Setup professional email forwarding
  - **Option A (Free)**: Use Cloudflare Email Routing
    - Add domain to Cloudflare (free account)
    - Enable Email Routing
    - Create route: hello@propertyflow.co.uk → your-personal@gmail.com
  - **Option B (Paid)**: Google Workspace (£5/month)
    - Professional, but overkill for early stage
    - Use only if you want native Gmail integration

- [ ] Test email forwarding
  - Send test email TO hello@propertyflow.co.uk FROM another account
  - Confirm it arrives in your personal inbox
  - Reply FROM hello@propertyflow.co.uk (setup reply-as in Gmail settings)

### Deliverable
✓ Working domain (propertyflow.co.uk)
✓ Professional email (hello@propertyflow.co.uk)

Subject: PropertyFlow early access — [First Name]

Hi [Name],

Thank you again for the insightful conversation about property management challenges back in [Month].

I'm excited to share that PropertyFlow is now in pilot with 3 UK property managers and launching Q2 2025.

Based on your feedback, we've prioritized:
- Compliance lifecycle tracking (Gas Safety, EPC, EICR, MEES)
- Airbnb iCal sync for STL revenue reconciliation
- Dual revenue model support (commission vs. fixed rent)

If you'd like early access when we launch, you can join the waitlist here:
[Link to propertyflow.co.uk]

Early waitlist members will receive:
- 20% discount on first year subscription
- Priority onboarding support
- Input on feature roadmap

Let me know if you have any questions. I'd love to keep you updated on our progress.

Best regards,
Simran
Founder, PropertyFlow

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Content Mistakes
❌ Claiming "thousands of users" when you're pre-revenue
❌ Website describes different product than business plan
❌ Pricing on website differs from business plan pricing
❌ Target customer mismatch (website: landlords 1-5 properties, plan: 10-100)
❌ Fake testimonials or stock photos with made-up names

### Technical Mistakes
❌ Broken links or 404 errors
❌ Form doesn't work (test submissions!)
❌ Mobile-unfriendly design (50% of traffic)
❌ Slow page load (>5 seconds)
❌ Domain doesn't work or shows "Coming Soon" indefinitely

### Timing Mistakes
❌ Delaying UKES submission to perfect website (done > perfect)
❌ Launching website day before submission (no time to gather signups)
❌ Forgetting to update business plan with website traction data
❌ Not testing thoroughly before sharing publicly

### Marketing Mistakes
❌ Spamming forums/groups with promotional links (you'll get banned)
❌ Posting on LinkedIn without personal context (looks like ad)
❌ Not following up with interview contacts (they're warmest leads)
❌ Forgetting to respond to contact form inquiries quickly

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I'm not technical — can I really build this myself?"
**Yes, if you use Carrd.co.**
- Carrd is designed for non-technical users
- Pre-built templates require minimal customization
- Drag-and-drop interface
- Takes 4-6 hours even for complete beginners
- £19/year (cheaper than hiring developer)

Alternative: Ask technical co-founder or hire freelancer on Fiverr (£50-100 for simple landing page)

### "I don't have a co-founder yet — should I mention this on website?"
**Approach**:
- If co-founder search is active: Add "Join our team" link in footer
- If you plan to bootstrap solo initially: Focus on YOUR background (Founder section)
- NEVER list a "co-founder" who isn't formally committed (equity agreement)

### "Should I wait until MVP is built before launching website?"
**No.**
- Landing page is for PRE-launch (that's the point)
- "Launching Q2 2025" is perfectly acceptable
- Waitlist is for FUTURE product access, not current product
- 90% of SaaS startups have landing page 3-6 months before product launch

### "What if I only get 10 waitlist signups, not 30?"
**Still submit.**
- 10 honest signups > 0 signups
- Acknowledge in business plan: "PropertyFlow has secured 10 waitlist signups in X weeks via landing page outreach"
- Focus on OTHER traction evidence (your 3 LOIs and 3 Pilot Agreements are strong)

### "Competitor might copy my idea if I publish landing page?"
**Unlikely.**
- Competitors are busy with existing customers
- Ideas are worthless, execution is everything
- You NEED public validation (waitlist) more than you need stealth mode
- If your idea is so easily copyable that a landing page threatens it, your business model needs work

---

## NEXT STEPS AFTER WEBSITE LAUNCH

### Week 2-4: Growth & Evidence Gathering
- Continue LinkedIn posts (3-5x/week)
- Email remaining interview contacts
- Monitor analytics and waitlist growth
- Respond to inbound inquiries within 24 hours

### Week 4: Pre-UKES Submission
- Export all evidence (CSV, screenshots, analytics)
- Update business plan with final numbers
- Take final landing page screenshot (include updated signup count)

### Post-UKES Submission: Maintain Momentum
- Keep website updated (fix any broken links, update copyright yearly)
- Continue adding waitlist signups (shows assessor that business is active if they check later)
- If you get UKES interview: Be ready to show website and discuss waitlist conversion strategy

## QUESTIONS?

If you encounter issues during implementation:

1. **Technical problems**: Search "[platform name] [problem]" on YouTube (e.g., "Carrd custom domain setup")
2. **Content questions**: Re-read WEBSITE_REQUIREMENTS_UKES_ASSESSMENT.md Section E (Recommended Website Structure)
3. **Traction strategy**: Review UKES_Traction_Checklist_PropertyFlow.md
4. **UKES-specific concerns**: Cross-reference with business plan to ensure 100% consistency

**Remember**: Done is better than perfect. A simple, honest, professional landing page built in 2 days is infinitely better than a "perfect" website you never launch.

**Launch your website this week. Gather signups for 2-4 weeks. Submit to UKES with confidence.**
