---

### Route C: "I'm time-constrained, just tell me the minimum"
**Timeline**: 2 days for minimal website

**Read this 5-minute summary, then execute:**

**What to build:**
- Single landing page (not multi-page site)
- Platform: Carrd.co (£19/year, easiest for non-technical)
- Content: Copy from landing_page_copy.txt sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Waitlist: Mailchimp free tier (embed form on page)

**What to do:**
1. Day 1 Morning: Register propertyflow.co.uk (£10, 1 hour)
2. Day 1 Afternoon: Setup email forwarding hello@propertyflow.co.uk (free, 1 hour)
3. Day 2: Build Carrd landing page using copy template (6-8 hours)
4. Day 3: Test thoroughly, publish, share with interview contacts

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't build complex multi-page site
- Don't exaggerate metrics ("thousands of users")
- Don't contradict your business plan
- Don't delay UKES submission for "perfect" website

**Minimum success criteria:**

- Email works (hello@propertyflow.co.uk receives mail)

- Content matches business plan 100%
- No typos, no broken links
- Mobile-responsive

**Best for**: Founders submitting to UKES within 2 weeks and need bare minimum

## KEY QUESTIONS ANSWERED

### Q: Is a website REQUIRED for UKES endorsement?
**A**: No, it's not explicitly required. BUT nearly all successful applications have digital presence. Assessors WILL Google "PropertyFlow UK" — give them something professional to find.

**Your situation**: You have strong traction (3 LOIs, 3 pilots, 15 interviews). Website is SUPPLEMENTARY, not make-or-break. But it can boost your probability from 65% → 80%.

---

### Q: Should I wait to submit UKES application until website is perfect?
**A**: NO. Done > perfect.

**Timeline recommendation**:
- If submitting in 2 weeks: Build minimal website (Days 1-3), submit
- If submitting in 4-6 weeks: Build minimal website, gather 30 signups, submit
- If submitting in 8+ weeks: Build extended website, gather 50+ signups, submit

**Do NOT delay submission** waiting for website perfection. Build minimal version, launch, gather signups for 2-4 weeks, then submit.

---

### Q: What if I'm not technical — can I build this myself?
**A**: Yes, if you use Carrd.co.

- Carrd is designed for non-technical users
- Pre-built templates, drag-and-drop interface
- £19/year (vs. £50-500 to hire freelancer)
- Takes 4-6 hours even for beginners
- All content is ready in landing_page_copy.txt (just copy-paste)

**Alternative**: Ask technical co-founder or hire on Fiverr (£50-100). But honestly, Carrd is so easy you should try it yourself first.

---

### Q: What's the #1 most important website element for UKES?
**A**: WAITLIST WITH VERIFIABLE SIGNUPS.

**Why**:
1. Quantifiable traction metric (30 signups > vague "strong interest")
2. Third-party validation (real people gave real emails)
3. Easy to verify (assessors can spot-check)
4. Demonstrates market pull, not just founder push

**Target**: 30 minimum, 50 strong, 100+ exceptional

**How**: Email interview contacts, post on LinkedIn, share in property forums. See QUICK_START_CHECKLIST.md Days 4-7.

---

### Q: What website mistakes harm Innovator Founder applications?
**A**: Top 5 fatal mistakes:

1. **Exaggerated claims**: "UK's leading platform" when pre-revenue → Credibility death
2. **Inconsistency with plan**: Website describes different product/pricing → Rejection risk
3. **Unprofessional execution**: Broken links, typos, copyright 2023 → Execution risk signal
4. **No waitlist/CTA**: Beautiful site but no traction mechanism → Missed opportunity
5. **Premature content**: E-commerce checkout for unreleased product → Wrong priorities

**Avoid all 5** by following the templates and checklists provided.

---

### Q: How much will this cost?
**A**: £10-50 total

**Breakdown**:
- Domain: £10-12/year (propertyflow.co.uk)
- Email: £0 (use free forwarding via Cloudflare or registrar)
- Website: £0-19 (Carrd Pro £19/year, or free Webflow/Vercel)
- Waitlist: £0 (Mailchimp free up to 500 subscribers)
- Analytics: £0 (Google Analytics 4 free)

**Total**: £10 if you use free tools, £31 if you use Carrd Pro

**ROI**: +15% endorsement probability from £10-50 investment

---

### Q: How long will this take?
**A**: ~20 hours over 7 days

**Day-by-day**:
- Day 1: 2 hours (domain + email)
- Day 2-3: 8-10 hours (build landing page)
- Day 4-7: 2-4 hours total (outreach 30-60 min/day)
- Day 7: 2 hours (analytics, documentation)

**Total**: 14-18 hours of focused work + 2-4 hours of daily outreach

**Realistic timeline**: Build over 1 week while continuing other UKES prep

---

### Q: What if I only get 10 waitlist signups, not 30?
**A**: Still submit to UKES.

- 10 honest signups > 0 signups
- Acknowledge realistically in business plan: "PropertyFlow has secured 10 waitlist signups in X weeks"
- Your OTHER traction (3 LOIs, 3 pilots, 15 interviews) is strong enough
- Website + 10 signups still improves your position vs. no website

**Don't let perfect be enemy of good.** Submit with what you have.

---

### Q: Will competitors steal my idea if I publish a landing page?
**A**: Extremely unlikely.

**Reality check**:
- Competitors are busy serving existing customers
- Ideas are worthless, execution is everything
- You NEED public validation (waitlist) more than stealth mode
- PropertyFlow's moat is execution + domain expertise, not secrecy

**Every successful SaaS** has public landing page 3-6 months before launch. You should too.

## COMMON PITFALLS (AVOID THESE)

### Content Pitfalls
- ❌ Claiming "thousands of users" when pre-revenue
- ❌ Website contradicts business plan (different pricing, target customer, product)
- ❌ Fake testimonials or unauthorized customer logos
- ❌ Vague language: "Revolutionary AI-powered platform" (buzzword bingo)

### Technical Pitfalls
- ❌ Broken links or form doesn't work
- ❌ Not mobile-friendly (50% of traffic)
- ❌ Slow load time (>5 seconds kills credibility)
- ❌ Domain doesn't work or shows "Coming Soon" forever

### Timing Pitfalls
- ❌ Delaying UKES submission for "perfect" website
- ❌ Launching website day before submission (no time for signups)
- ❌ Not updating business plan with website data
- ❌ Forgetting to test before sharing publicly

### Marketing Pitfalls
- ❌ Spamming forums with promotional links (you'll get banned)
- ❌ Not following up with interview contacts (warmest leads)
- ❌ Posting on LinkedIn without personal context (looks like ad)
- ❌ Ignoring contact form inquiries (respond within 24 hours)

**Follow the checklists** to avoid all of these.
