## SECTION 7: FOUNDER/ABOUT (Optional but Recommended)

**Section Heading:**
About PropertyFlow

**Founder Bio:**
Founded by Simran Preet Singh, MSc Cyber Security (Distinction, University of East Anglia). After experiencing compliance delays as a UK tenant, Simran interviewed 15 property managers and discovered systematic failures in certificate tracking. PropertyFlow applies security compliance frameworks to property compliance — automating audit trails, deadline management, and regulatory reporting.

**Alternative shorter version:**
PropertyFlow was founded to solve a problem I experienced firsthand: UK rental compliance is broken. After interviewing 15 property managers, we discovered 93% face the same challenge — tracking certificates across spreadsheets, missing deadlines, facing penalties. PropertyFlow automates this entirely.

## TESTIMONIAL/QUOTE USAGE RULES

**SAFE TO USE (from your 15 interviews):**
- Anonymized quotes with generic attribution
- Example: "Property Manager, Edinburgh (35 properties)"
- Example: "Landlord, 15 units, London"

**DO NOT USE:**
- Full names without written permission
- Company names without permission
- Fake testimonials or stock photos
- Quotes from friends/family presented as customers

**YOUR ACTUAL QUOTES (from business plan Section 1.2):**
✓ "I've been fined £1,200 for one expired gas certificate. I need alerts, not spreadsheets." — Property Manager, Edinburgh (35 properties)

✓ "We spend 2 days every month reconciling Airbnb bookings with our accounts. It's madness." — Letting Agent, Manchester (22 properties)

**Recommendation**: Use these 2 quotes. They're from real interviews, properly anonymized, and demonstrate specific pain points.

---

## COLOR SCHEME SUGGESTIONS (Optional)

**Professional/Trust (Recommended for Property/Compliance):**
- Primary: Navy blue (#1E3A8A) or Deep teal (#0F766E)
- Secondary: Light blue (#BFDBFE) or Light teal (#CCFBF1)
- Accent: Orange (#F97316) for CTAs
- Background: White (#FFFFFF) or Light gray (#F9FAFB)

**Modern/Tech:**
- Primary: Dark purple (#7C3AED)
- Secondary: Light purple (#DDD6FE)
- Accent: Green (#10B981) for CTAs
- Background: White

**Recommendation**: Use professional/trust colors for property management. It signals stability and compliance (your core value prop).

---

## FONT SUGGESTIONS (Optional)

**Safe Professional Combinations:**
- Headings: Inter (Google Fonts - free)
- Body: Inter (same font for consistency)

**Alternative:**
- Headings: Outfit or Montserrat (bold)
- Body: Inter or Open Sans (readable)

**Recommendation**: Stick with Inter for everything. It's clean, professional, readable, and free. Don't overthink fonts.

---

## IMAGE/VISUAL SUGGESTIONS

**What to include (if space/design allows):**
1. Simple icon set for features (compliance, documents, tenancy, revenue, automation)
   - Use: Heroicons (free), Feather Icons (free), or Font Awesome (free)

2. Simple diagram of "How it Works" flow
   - Upload documents → System tracks expiry → Get alerts → Renew on time
   - Use: Excalidraw (free), Figma (free tier), or Canva (free tier)

3. Founder photo (professional headshot)
   - Use your LinkedIn profile photo
   - Should look professional, not casual/party photo

**What NOT to include:**
- Stock photos of generic office workers (looks fake)
- Screenshots of software that doesn't exist yet (misleading)
- Fake customer logos or testimonials
- Overly complex animations or graphics (slows page load)

**Recommendation**: Keep it SIMPLE. Icons + one diagram maximum. PropertyFlow's strength is clarity, not flashy design.

---

## MOBILE-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

**Test on mobile:**
- Hero headline should be readable (not too small)
- CTA buttons should be thumb-friendly (minimum 44px tall)
- Forms should auto-focus on email field
- No horizontal scrolling
- Images should scale down properly

**Mobile hero optimization:**
Break long headline into 2 lines:
```
Compliance-first property management
for UK landlords managing 10-100 properties
```

**Mobile CTA stacking:**
Put both CTAs vertically on mobile (not side-by-side):
[Join Waitlist] (full width)
